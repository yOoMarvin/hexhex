# hexhex - Your modern and simple color converter for ios

## About the project
This project was made in scope of the [100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/yOoMarvin/100-days-of-code). The goal was to get more fit in ios development and swift.  
In my design library I have a lot of color palettes, but often they are just in hex codes. So I've thought... why not making a little beautiful ios app for that! And here it goes!

I've also made a little prototype in Adobe XD which can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/60d6207b-cc6b-4acf-a0aa-8dddf24e07b6/).  

Additionally I've already tried some stuff out in playgrounds and published this to a [gist](https://gist.github.com/yOoMarvin/9697835a722d72be7c485b3f1d2d3614)
